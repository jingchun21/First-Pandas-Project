# First-Pandas-Project
Sale Project
It is my first project. It was harder and funnier than I thought. First I have to rerun everthing on the second and other days. 
It makes the table having more and more repeats. I didn't realize it till I get unexpected results. I have to figure out the reasons.
I am happy I did find the causes. Then I decide to save all the datafram to csv file. so I don't need to rerun from the beginning. 
Meanwhile, when I tried to create a datafrom but I forgot to add the columns name, it screwed up the whole data. For example, I tried to
add more columns to df step by step. then I wrote the code df= df['column']*2. Then all other columns are gone. This frustrate me a lot.
when you look at my codes, I have to rerun back and forth or add something else.
If somebody can give me advice, I will apprecite your help. 
I updated the code and make it more clean and better. when I update it, I had some other problems. like I used dropna (how = 'all), somehow there are still na values. then I have to use dropna(axis=0). I still dont know why the first one is not working.
It is fun!!!
